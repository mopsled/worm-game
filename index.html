		<h1>Collaborative two-player<br/>item-driven snake</h1>
		<section id="main">
			<p>We've taken the classic game of snake and updated it, adding a large number of features to make a <strong>challenging, innovative</strong> game. We've thrown aside imperative programming and created a <strong>beautifully simple</strong> system of <strong>functionally-defined</strong> items. We've implemented a variety of these items, including items that <strong>grow, shrink, destroy, slow,</strong> and even <strong>teleport</strong> a player's snake across the board. Even better, we've made new items incredibly easy to create. Just check out the code needed to create a portal object, <strong>taken from our project:</strong></p>
			<pre>
<code class="javascript">57    var PORTAL_ACTION = function(player) {
58    	worms[player].position.x = getRandomX();
59    	worms[player].position.y = getRandomY();
60    }</code></pre>
			<p>Also, we've changed the classical snake paradigm to a <strong>collaborative</strong> two-player game. <strong>Players must work together</strong> to coordinate collecting food, sharing items, and avoiding collision as they struggle for a high score.</p>
